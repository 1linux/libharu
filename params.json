{"body":"**libHaru** is a free, cross platform, open source library for generating PDF files.\r\nAt this moment libHaru does not support reading and editing existing PDF files and it's unlikely this support will ever appear.\r\n\r\nIt supports the following features:\r\n* Generating PDF files with lines, text, images.\r\n* Outline, text annotation, link annotation.\r\n* Compressing document with deflate-decode.\r\n* Embedding PNG, Jpeg images.\r\n* Embedding Type1 font and TrueType font.\r\n* Creating encrypted PDF files.\r\n* Using various character sets (ISO8859-1~16, MSCP1250~8, KOI8-R).\r\n* Supporting CJK fonts and encodings.\r\nYou can add the feature of PDF creation by using HARU without understanding complicated internal structure of PDF.\r\nlibHaru is written in ANSI C, so theoretically it supports most of the modern OSes.\r\n\r\n## News\r\n\r\n### libHaru 2.3.0RC2\r\n* Changed package naming, no other changes was done.\r\n\r\n### libHaru 2.3.0RC1\r\n* Added support for 3dMeasures of subtype PD3 and 3DC, projection annotations, ExData and javascript attached to a U3D model.
